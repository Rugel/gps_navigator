# gps_navigator

### Project description

This project is an example of using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/50.7103/21.1064) and the library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to build a practical application. [Gps_navigator](https://rugel.github.io/gps_navigator/) is used to determine the mileage of the A2 motorway section Gręzów - Swoboda under construction in relation to the user on the construction site. If the user is not on the construction site, his distance in a straight line to the so-called point 0 + 000. In addition, the application allows you to click on the map to visualize mileage points in relation to the established line of the road under construction.
